# Plugins for the Microsoft Azure Service Bus .NET Standard client

This repository is for plugins for the [.NET Standard Azure Service Bus library](https://github.com/azure/azure-service-bus-dotnet).

Azure Service Bus is an asynchronous messaging cloud platform that enables you to send messages between decoupled systems. Microsoft offers this feature as a service, which means that you do not need to host any of your own hardware in order to use it.

Refer to the [online documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) to learn more about Service Bus.

This library is built using .NET Standard 1.3. For more information on what platforms are supported see [.NET Platforms Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library#net-platforms-support).
